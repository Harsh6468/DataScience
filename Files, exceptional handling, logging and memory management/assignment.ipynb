    "#### **1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?**\n",
    "- **Interpreted Languages:**\n",
    "    - The source code is executed line-by-line by an interpreter. This typically means there is no separate compilation step; code is executed directly, which can allow for greater flexibility and easier debugging. However, it may run slower because the interpretation happens at runtime.\n",
    "- **Compiled Languages:**\n",
    "    - The source code is translated into machine code by a compiler before execution. This process produces an executable file that runs directly on the hardware. Compiled programs often run faster because the translation is done ahead of time, but they might be less flexible during development.\n"
